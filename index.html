			<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

              <p>After studying at MTSU I decided to take a break from my STEM background and do a year of service with the Americorps VISTA program. I worked on a multi-agency collaboration that spanned both city government and non-profit agencies. My project was to help refine Nashville's system of getting services to those experiencing homelessness.</p>

I would like to continue to make contributions via my technical skills to the mental health field.</p>

          			I began in Day Cohort 14 at Nashville Software School in May 2016. I wanted to get back into software development, and it was my best option at the time. It turned out to be my best option in general. Here I learned more that just CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I also learned many tools and techniques to be a good developer and work as a team. My favorite part of the program was organizing and helping my classmates during group projects.
